# P2-Kinetic-Sculpture
#### I400 Prototyping With Arduino Tools - Project 2: Kinetic Sculpture

Device built and programmed by Amanda Sill and Joseph Palmer

Components:
* 2 Arduino Unos
* 2 Stepper Motors & Drivers
* 2 Ultrasonic Distance Sensors
* 9 Neopixels
* Screws, bolts, nuts
* 20 gauge wire

Housing, image plate, and gears were all laser cut. Device is powered using 4 9v batteries.

If one of the distance sensors detects something within one meter of the device, it cycles through the full image reveal rotation.
